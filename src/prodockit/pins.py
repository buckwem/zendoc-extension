"""Finds every place a build-input version is declared across a project,
and moves them all together.

A project that pins its build inputs ends up declaring the same version in
several files at once - a floor in ``pyproject.toml``, an exact pin in each
CI workflow that builds the docs, another in whatever job checks for drift.
They have to agree, nothing enforces that they do, and the failure when
they disagree is quiet: CI builds with one version while the declared
floor says another, and the published output stops matching what anyone
tested.

This module reads them all, so raising a version is one answer rather than
a hunt through four files.

**Operators are preserved per site.** A library declares a floor
(``zensical>=0.0.52``) because an exact pin in package metadata propagates
to every consumer; a build pins exactly (``zensical==0.0.52``) because its
output is an artifact. Both are correct, and setting a new version keeps
each as it was rather than flattening them to one form.

**Both hosts.** GitHub Actions keeps its jobs in ``.github/workflows/``;
GitLab CI keeps them in ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` (or ``.gitlab/``). Both are
scanned, along with ``pyproject.toml`` and any ``requirements``/
``constraints`` files, so the same command works whichever a project uses.

The versions themselves are matched textually rather than by parsing each
file format, because the point is to rewrite them in place without
reformatting the file around them - the same approach
:mod:`prodockit.sync_repo` takes to ``zensical.toml``.

from prodockit import __version__

#: Build inputs whose version a prodockit project normally pins. Zensical
#: renders the site prodockit builds from, and WeasyPrint decides
#: pagination - which is content here, since page numbers resolve into the
#: back-of-book index and the Table of Contents. Override with
#: `packages=` for a project that pins something else too.
#:
#: Pandoc is here despite never appearing as a pip specifier - it is a
#: `PANDOC_VERSION` CI variable, matched by the "env" kind below. It earns
#: its place all the same: pandoc is not always compatible with itself
#: across releases, and 3.10 stopped accepting a syntax-highlighted
#: `<pre><code>` as a code block, so every fenced code block in the PDF
#: reflowed as justified prose on it while an older pinned pandoc kept
#: publishing correctly (prodockit-extensions#207). An unpinned pandoc is
#: exactly the kind of drift this module exists to catch, and was the one
#: build input three sibling projects were keeping in step by hand, across
#: workflow files, with a comment saying "keep in sync"
#: (prodockit-extensions#209).
#:
#: Markdown and pymdown-extensions are here despite being *transitive* -
#: they arrive under Zensical, not as anything a project installs directly.
#: That is exactly why they need watching: Zensical declares only floors
#: for them, so pinning Zensical itself fixes nothing about the library
#: that actually turns every page's Markdown into HTML - a floor still
#: resolves to whatever is newest on the day the build runs
#: (prodockit-extensions#178).
#:
#: They matter more to prodockit than to most projects that render
#: Markdown, because prodockit does not merely display the result:
#: :mod:`prodockit.pdf.css` and :mod:`prodockit.pdf.lua` both match on the
#: specific class shapes pymdownx emits, so the renderer is an input to the
#: PDF's own correctness rather than only to the website's appearance.
#: `prodockit` is watched for the same reason as the rest, and its
#: absence here had the consequence the rest were added to prevent: the
#: template pinned `prodockit==0.35.0` and drifted two releases behind
#: without anything noticing, because the one command that looks at pins
#: was not looking at this one (prodockit-template#173). Moving it needed
#: `-p prodockit` typed by hand, which is precisely the step nobody
#: remembers to take.
#:
#: It belongs on the list on the merits, too: prodockit renders the PDF
#: and generates the back-of-book index, so its version changes a
#: project's published output as directly as Zensical's does.
#:
#: Safe to include even in this repository, where prodockit is the
#: project rather than a dependency: the pattern requires a version
#: operator after the name, so `name = "prodockit"` and `version =
#: "0.36.2"` in `pyproject.toml` are not declarations and are left alone.

    with `#`, so one rule covers all of them.

    This exists because the matching is textual, and a version specifier
    reads the same whether it is a declaration or prose *about* one. A
    comment explaining why a package is pinned would otherwise be reported
    as a declaration site, counted towards the consistency check, and

    Two things it deliberately does not do:

    - **Nothing before the `#` is discarded.** A trailing comment after a
      real declaration (``zensical==0.0.53  # pinned deliberately``) must
      leave the declaration findable, so callers compare match positions
      against this index rather than dropping the whole line.
    - **A `#` inside quotes is not a comment.** ``image: "python:3.13#tag"``
      is contrived here, but treating it as a comment would silently stop
      scanning mid-line, which is the same class of quiet wrongness this
      function exists to prevent. Escapes are not tracked - no file type
      scanned here needs them, and guessing would be worse than the simple

#: prefix keyword to require - `PANDOC_VERSION` is itself the whole
#: declaration, so the package name must be immediately followed by
#: `_VERSION`.
#:
#: `op` captures the literal text between the name and the version -

#: template. A CI variable name is conventionally upper-case
#: (`PANDOC_VERSION`, not `pandoc_version`), and unlike a runner label or

#: workflow stops finding its own variable. Capturing the true text once
#: and reusing it verbatim (see `apply_version`) is simpler than
